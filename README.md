# Functions
Bline- It represents a straight line segment connecting two points.
kbhit()- It is present in conio.h and used to determine if a key has been pressed or not.
delay()- It is used to suspend execution of a program for a particular time.
cleardevice()- The header file graphics.h contains cleardevice() function which clears the screen in graphics mode and sets the current position to (0,0). Clearing the screen consists of filling the screen with current background color.

initgraph() - It initializes the graphics system by loading a graphics driver from disk (or validating a registered driver), and putting the system into graphics mode.
restorecrtmode()- It restores the original video mode detected by initgraph.
closegraph()- The header file graphics.h contains closegraph() function which closes the graphics mode, deallocates all memory allocated by graphics system and restores the screen to the mode it was in before you called initgraph.
